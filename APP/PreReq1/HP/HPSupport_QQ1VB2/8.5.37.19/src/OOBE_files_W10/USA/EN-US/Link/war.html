About Contact Options and Warranty Status Information
</h2>
<p>
By checking this box you are granting HP your permission to use your registration information, including the serial number and product number of your PC and any attached HP product (e.g. a printer or monitor), to provide you with personalized information about your products.  Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Contact options to obtain help for your specific PC model (or attached HP product) including your country and language.
</li>
<li>
The warranty status of your PC to identify the HP support coverage for your PC or any attached HP product and provide you with warranty status notifications and extension options.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you choose not to check this box, HP will not check your warranty status today. However, your HP product is configured to undertake warranty status checks and provide you with important status messaging at key stages in the lifecycle of your HP products. These warranty status checks confirm the status and coverage period of your HP product standard warranty and/or registered HP Care Pack service and report that status to you.
Each message will provide you with information on how to opt out of future warranty status messaging for all HP products, or you can do so at any time by opening the Settings section in HP Support Assistant (not recommended).
</p>
<h3>

HP Support Assistant, software updates, and important messages
</h2>
<p>
HP Support Assistant is a pre-installed application on your PC which will help keep your HP devices up-to-date to maintain security and performance.
</br>
</br>
HP Support Assistant will automatically detect whether important HP messages and software and driver updates (1) are available for your PC and printer(s) and display the messages and/or install the software updates, if possible for your device.  Important messages, drivers and software include those intended to avoid potential data loss, security vulnerabilities, loss of major functionality and other situations that have the potential to negatively affect the use of your PC and printer(s).  In a few cases, you may be asked to approve the installation before it proceeds.
</br>
</br>
Scan and installation results are sent from your computer to HP but do not contain personal information.
</br>
</br>
<i>
(1) Updates provided by HP Support Assistant are in addition to those provided by Microsoft through Windows Updates.
